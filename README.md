### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I hit a roadblock when I tried to implement the delete boards button after adding cards. It took me a while but I figured out that it was a database issue where you can't delete a board(parent) if it has cards in it(cards) because ech card is associated with a board and so deleteing a board means cards will exist without a board. The solution was to add something known as "Cascading" to allow the delete function to first delete every child component before deleting the parent component.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I probably would have added more styles to make my web app more appealing to the eye

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
